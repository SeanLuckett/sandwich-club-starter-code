    <string name="sandwich_description_placeholder">Vada Pav is a vegetarian fast
            food dish native to the Indian state of Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried
            potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the
            middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chilli pepper.
            It originated as cheap street food in Mumbai, but is now served in food stalls and
            restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay Burger in keeping with its origins
            and its resemblance in physical form to a
            burger.
